# Class 15: Looking to the Future: Code 301 Preview and Project Week

<a id="top"></a>
# Today's Plan: Week 3, Friday Lecture... LAST CLASS DAY!

#### The Code 301 entrance exam will be published later today. It will be due at 11:59pm on Sunday night. Allow yourself about an hour to complete it. Take your time, be methodical, and kick its butt.

- Announcements
  - Reminder: weekly surveys will go out to students today. As always, thank you for your feedback!
  - Starting at 9:00a on Monday morning is a blackout window on submitting classwork (including late assignments and any resubmissions) during Project Week. In other words, you should be **100%** focused on your project during Project Week. The exceptions to that are the final BusMall submission and the 301 exam, each of which is due at 11:59pm Sunday 12/18. But for the rest of the week, do not spend energy on catching up on past assignments.
  - You'll have one week after project presentations to turn in any lingering late work or resubmissions. The deadline for that will be Friday 12/30 at 11:59pm.
  - The instructional staff will go into the gradebook and "zero out" any previously unsubmitted assignments this weekend. This is just an administrative step to show you exactly where you stand if you do not submit any additional assignments or do any resubmits of previous assignments.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 15 of Code 201, students will:

- Have an understanding of the fundamentals of Code 301 topics, as measured by observations from the instructional staff during class discussion.
- Have an understanding of how to successfully integrate Git and GitHub into a team code project, as measured by successful completion of the final project.

## Readings

- No readings for today! But keep in mind it is time to start getting into the habit of doing regular daily reading of tech articles, Twitter feeds, and other resources. A great time to do this: on your commute if you bus or train or whatever. And if you drive, there's podcasts! Always Be Learning!
