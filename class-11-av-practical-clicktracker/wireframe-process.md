# Wireframe Process

Up to this point you've probably been building HTML pages (like the ones in the About Me and the Cookie Stand Projects) like this:

1. Put some content into the HTML and apply markup
2. Apply some CSS to it to try to get it to look the way you want.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 some number of times until all content is in place.
4. Grow increasingly annoyed that your page does not look like you want.
5. "Oh, crap, I better push this to GitHub!" and make your first ACP.

Let's review a professional approach to setting up a web document, or more specifically, the look and feel of an application.

1. Have a design concept and plan completely ready to go before you write the first line of code.
  1. Wireframe showing all document dimensions
  2. Know where images will go and how big they will be
  3. Use placeholder images during the setup process
  4. Know where text will go and use placeholder *lorem ipsum* text
2. Set up the project repository, scaffold the files, and make sure they are wired together.

4. Build out all of the HTML without applying any classes or IDs

6. Working top to bottom in the document, put elements into place with CSS, using the structure of the HTML to create selectors wherever it is possible. Seek to limit use of classes and IDs to necessity.

8. Tweak responsiveness to the extent it is part of the design.
