# Student Comments from Week 2

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Nothing in particular really comes to mind. 

- It was the material in the sense that it is getting harder but that is why I am here and not doing on my own.

- The lecture. Sam does a great job of explaining concepts, but the pace is far too slow for me. I understand, however, that he cannot accommodate everyone's learning style and speed, so I don't mind.

- reading

- The Reading is just too much on top of everything. Rather than reading everything, perhaps focusing on a certain important sections and the rest is for reference when needed.

- Everything seemed to be helpful this week. This week was intense, so I mean everything I could get, help, I appreciated. I guess busy work, like readings is all.

- project felt very repetitive and a bit slow.

- We only spent one day talking about javascript event concepts, really not enough to explore the capabilities and implementations.

- past week average wait time > one hour to get TA help, meanwhile I beat my brain out to do javascript the wrong way thousand times. When the TA finally came around and showed my algorithm/code flaws < 5 minutes I felt so stupid.

- I found all aspect helpful in their own way.

- I really don't know. I feel like it was a fairly straightforward and brutal week.

- I feel like we should have question time at the every end of lecture so we don't go off track and end up in a rabbit hole. When we go off in a tangent I often zone out and find it hard to get back into the zone. Lecture time should be structured to make sure we cover all the major points/concepts. So please keep all comments/questions toward the very end.

- I think the little ted talk videos are a waste of time.

- Learning journals

- I am just tired at this point. It is hard to keep up when I am tired. I wish I could have more time to sleep and read and study ... But I'll just keep going on regardless.

- Lecture

- having difficulty keeping up with the labs (DOM, objects, constructors)

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Projects 1st and lectures.

- I feel like the stacked module model and the way the curriculum is structured has made me learn a lot more than I expected.

- The material, the harder the better. Everyday I look forward to come here and learn more stuff.

- The lab, of course. It's really when I learn concepts because I'm getting to solve problems on my own and actually try things out.

- lab

- The lab work is challenging and relevant.

- The excellent help from the TA's and Sam. Struggling with questions and drowning in code, sucks but when you have people who know the content better, its helpful. Lab time was awesome.

- learning the wireframing technique

- wireframe exercise hints.md and instructor Sam did part of index.html in class and showed us tool like Placehold.it, it saved me lots of anguish.

- the lab aspect

- Lab time is the best, if there were more TAs to help.

- The morning code reviews provided answers to a lot of the questions I had; though sometimes it seemed as if things were flying by so fast that I was unable to focus enough on new concepts because the previous concepts already had me in a stranglehold in a back alley.

- Lab time is still the most helpful for me. I learn best when I'm actively doing something- hands on.

- lab sessions, peer to peer problem solving, the Saturday session with Kevia.

- Working with other students and getting help from the TAs during lab. The lab prep this week also felt less rushed and had more guidelines and hints to get us started. The discussion on abstractions helped put what we are learning into context. Lecture on DOM and events were good and supplemented textbook readings.

- Spending time with the TAs and going over my own code again and again. Having the videos so that I could watch things that I missed during class.

- Lab

- I couldn't find anything.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- No

- No questions guys, keep with the good work. You guys are making a difference in my life.

- Nope! Keep on keeping on. You're all doing a good job. :-)

- When lecture isn't broken up into very small sections it tends to meander and grow. I would like to suggest a lecture > demonstration > practice pattern in lecture. If you have 3 topics to cover give each topic 1 hour, spend 15 minutes in lecture, then in demonstration, then have the TA's go among the students while they practice for 15 minutes. The last 15 minutes would be for break/student interruptions/deviations like weather.

- No :) Everything is coming along well

- The only problem i found at times was a shortage of TAs.

- I am concerned that the balance between reading and actual practice is off. The reading doesn't help much at all.

- What would make this class even better is to make lecture slides available for students. We can choose to print them or not, but make them available for those who want to take notes on them.

- no

- We are starting to get introduced to topics that are new (not necessarily covered in some of the Code Academy pre-work). This is exciting, but also really challenging given the short time that we have! I think the more prepared that students are, the more they'll benefit from this class. An idea or suggestion would be to provide suggested readings and/or a listing of topics that maybe students can look into, as part of an optional pre-work for this course.

- I'm just going to show up everyday and do the best I can....... It's been really stressful.
