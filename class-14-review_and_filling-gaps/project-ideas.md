# Project ideas

Yana: Memory game. 16-100 cards. Flip two cards, find matches as you go. Classic take on the "Concentration" game.

Rose Anne: Generate a page w info on a small town or neighborhood, for example. Where to get utilities, 24 hour pharmacies, auto registry, walk-in clinics, local 24 hour diners.

Brian A: Roll The Bones. Farkle? 6 dice, straights and scores. Yahtzee on steroids and crack with 6 dice?

Jeffy: 3 options of balls to throw at hipsters. This is like Eric Cartman and hippies.

Gary: Choose your own adventure. You know, for kids!!!

Annie: Adventures of Lady & the Tramp (not the Sinatra version). Treasure hunting.

Collin: Education system sucks. Doesn't match our oppressive economy. Make a site for a profile to meet people and view live feeds, etc.

Ophelia: 25% of Americans manage blood sugar with exercise, diet, etc. Make an app to help track it, chart the results. Improve predictions of food/activities over time based on individual metabolism?

Siamak: Same as Gary but different. Show photos to kids where parents can record kids' ideas and record their childhood stories.
