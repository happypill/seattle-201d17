## Git Workflow For Teams

Teamwork in Git is a whole other animal. Let's talk about it. There's a great reference document in this repo. I mean, really, it's the best. Any other Git reference documents are just disgraceful.

## Advanced JS topics

We're going to explore some advanced JS topics with *Eloquent JavaScript* and other sources. The goal is not to study them in a manner such that you are going to immediately have command over them, but to give you a basic understanding of what these topics are and find good resources for them. Some of this stuff is something you need to see a few times to really grok it.

## Project Pitches & Project Teams

**Teams!**
Let's assemble our teams!

**Project Selection Process**

We'll collect (in this document) and discuss a series of project pitches today and tomorrow. The teams may pick any one of the projects they want to build, or, teams/individuals can come back tomorrow and present additional pitches. You'll spend lab time tomorrow afternoon finalizing a project selection and beginning brainstorming and planning on it.

**Q:** Is it OK if multiple teams select the same project?
**A:** Yep.

**Q:** Can teams come up with a new project idea and pivot to it over the weekend?
**A:** Only with Sam's approval, which should be done via a direct message in Slack. Note that Sam is generally not on Slack a lot on weekends. Some, but not a lot, but usually responds within a few hours.

**Project Plan Review**

On Monday morning, before noon, each team will meet with the instructional staff and review each team's project plan. Your plans should be very detailed, including site architecture,  wireframes of your pages, diagrams of how you are going to organize and solve your problem domain in code (including all points for user input and what the handlers for each of those points will do), plus anything else that you've worked out in advance (naming conventions for variables, for instance, plus things like Git process, branch/issue names, color palettes, custom font selections, whatever goes into the project.)

**Q:** Can we start writing code over the weekend?
**A:** NO. The only exception is if there is need to create a technical proof-of-concept, and that exception must be recommended and/or approved by Sam.

**Q:** What format should our project plans be in?
**A:** Google Docs is a good way to collaborate on text-based content like lists, outlines, descriptions, etc. For wireframes, hand-sketched documents are fine. There are computer-based wireframe tools, but then there is the headache of learning the tool.
