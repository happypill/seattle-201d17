# HTML/CSS Wireframe Exercise

Create a new repo on Github called 'wirefame_exercise' and clone it to your laptop.

Add `index.html`, `reset.css`, and `style.css` files to the repo. Wire up the CSS files in \<link> tags, making sure to have the reset first.

The specifications for the wireframe are in the adjacent image documents in this directory. One of the images shows what the finished product should look like, and the other shows specifications and dimensions.

Follow along with the class lecture that will be done in CodePen, entering your code in the files.

We will only complete part of this wireframe in class; you will need to do the rest over the weekend.
